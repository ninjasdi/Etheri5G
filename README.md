## Etheri5G Story
Back in 2019, ninjasdi, a passionate gamer, decided he wanted to make his own video games. He wasn’t happy just playing games—he wanted to create them. So, over the next few years, he spent his time learning game development, experimenting with different tools, and building up his skills.

By 2022, after a lot of self-teaching and practice, ninjasdi took the leap and founded his own indie game company called [Etheri5G](https://ninjasdi.github.io/etheri5g/). The goal wasn’t to create a huge studio, but to make fun and unique games with heart and creativity.

The first big project under [Etheri5G](https://ninjasdi.github.io/etheri5g/) was a game called The Artyus Adventure. It was supposed to be an exciting action-adventure game, with a rich world and interesting characters. Ninjasdi announced that the game would be released on Xbox in September 2024, and he was determined to make it happen.

However, things didn’t go as planned. As development continued into 2023, the game became harder to finish. The scope of the game kept growing, and ninjasdi struggled to keep up with all the challenges—bugs, time constraints, and balancing the vision with the reality of indie game development. After much thought, he made the difficult decision to cancel The Artyus Adventure.

But instead of giving up, ninjasdi took what he learned from that experience and moved forward. In September 2024, [Etheri5G](https://ninjasdi.github.io/etheri5g/) released a new game called [Antares on War]([https://etheri5g.github.io](https://ninjasdi.github.io/etheri5g/)), a strategy action game set in space. It was released on [itch.io](https://etheri5g.itch.io), but despite the effort put into it, the game didn’t gain much traction, and updates were eventually canceled.

Even so, ninjasdi didn’t see this as a failure. He created a website for the game and the company, showcasing everything [Etheri5G](https://ninjasdi.github.io/etheri5g/) had worked on so far. The website was a reminder of how far he'd come and how much he had learned.

Through all the challenges, ninjasdi remained determined. Each game, whether successful or not, helped him grow as a developer. He wasn’t in this for the fame or quick success—he just wanted to create meaningful games. And with each project, [Etheri5G](https://ninjasdi.github.io/etheri5g/) kept moving forward, one step at a time.
